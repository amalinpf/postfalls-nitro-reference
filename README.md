# NITRO Reference Guide (Internal)

Live, browsable quick-reference for Crow Canyon NITRO functions and examples.

## Structure
- `index.html` — Main manual (served by GitHub Pages)
- `docs/` — Supplemental DOCX/notes (not canonical sources; optional links from "More Info")
- `kb-html/` — Local HTML exports (only if you want local previews; canonical links go to crowcanyon.help)
- `archive/` — Old WIP/manual variants you want to keep out of the root
- `anchors-map.csv` — Optional: map function → anchored crowcanyon.help URL
- `supplemental/` — Raw notes and DOCX references, not part of the published site (merged into `/docs` over time)

## Canonical Sources
Always link to Crow Canyon help with anchored URLs, e.g.:
