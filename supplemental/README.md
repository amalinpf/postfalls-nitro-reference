# Supplemental Notes for NITRO Documentation

This folder contains **raw reference material** collected over the years while working with Crow Canyon NITRO Studio.  

⚠️ **Important:** These files are **not part of the published GitHub Pages site**. They are stored here for internal use, research, and for consolidating into the structured manual under `/docs`.

---

## Contents
- **Functions/**  
  Drafts and original references for function syntax and definitions.

- **Workflows/**  
  Notes on workflow-specific behaviors, conditions, and query list actions.

- **CustomActions/**  
  Examples and use cases for Custom Actions, including Execute Script.

- **Forms/**  
  NITRO Forms customization notes, form events, validations, and tweaks.

- **Misc/**  
  Everything else (formatting experiments, variable passing, placeholders, etc.).

---

## Usage
- Treat these as **source material** only.  
- Duplicate/redundant information is expected; it will be merged and normalized into the `/docs` manual.  
- If updating or adding new notes, keep them in the correct subfolder and try to preserve original filenames for traceability.

---

## Publishing
- The `/supplemental` folder is **ignored by GitHub Pages** and will not appear on the live site.  
- Consolidated, cleaned-up content goes into `/docs`.
